# Architecture

This document describes what the system _does_, organized by feature — one entry
per user-facing capability, never one per phase and never one per module. Read it
top-to-bottom to learn the capabilities; follow the symbol links to find the code.

Every entry follows one fixed template:

### <Feature name — a user-facing capability, not a module or a phase>

<One line: what this capability does.>

- Symbol.Name — path/to/file.ext:line
- Another.Symbol — path/to/other.ext:line

_introduced <phase-id> · extended <phase-id> · <short-sha>_

Entries are maintained automatically: dross-ship merges each phase's landmarks
into the matching feature entry (updating in place), and /dross-architecture can
regenerate the whole document from a scan of the code and git history.
